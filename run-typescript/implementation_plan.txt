Implementation Plan for Missing Actions:

1. Uber: Book (pickup, dropoff, type) -> ID
   - Create a new file `uberBook.ts` in the `actions/uber` directory.
   - Implement a function that uses Playwright to interact with the Uber booking page, inputting the pickup, dropoff, and type parameters, and retrieving the booking ID.

2. Uber: Check how far (ID) -> Obj
   - Create a new file `uberCheckDistance.ts` in the `actions/uber` directory.
   - Implement a function that uses the booking ID to check the status of the ride and returns an object with the distance and estimated time of arrival.

3. Delta / United: Check_in (booking_reference, last_name) -> Success / Fail
   - Create a new file `airlineCheckIn.ts` in the `actions/airlines` directory.
   - Implement a function that uses Playwright to automate the check-in process on both Delta and United's websites using the booking reference and last name.

4. Delta / United: Search_flights (origin, destination, departure_date, return_date, class) -> List
   - Create a new file `airlineSearchFlights.ts` in the `actions/airlines` directory.
   - Implement a function that searches for flights on both Delta and United's websites with the given parameters and returns a list of available flights.

5. Instacart: Order (query)
   - Create a new file `instacartOrder.ts` in the `actions/instacart` directory.
   - Implement a function that uses Playwright to place an order on Instacart using the query parameter.

For each of these actions, the `APP_CONFIG` object in `config.ts` will be updated to include the new actions, following the existing pattern:

export const APP_CONFIG: { [key: string]: AppConfig } = {
  // ... existing configurations ...
  uber: {
    url: "https://www.uber.com",
    actions: {
      book: uberBook,
      checkDistance: uberCheckDistance,
      // Add other Uber actions here
    },
  },
  airlines: {
    url: "https://www.delta.com",
    actions: {
      checkIn: airlineCheckIn,
      searchFlights: airlineSearchFlights,
      // Add other Airline actions here
    },
  },
  instacart: {
    url: "https://www.instacart.com",
    actions: {
      order: instacartOrder,
      // Add other Instacart actions here
    },
  },
};

Dependencies:
- Playwright: Already used in the project, will be used for web automation.
- TypeScript: The project is already using TypeScript, so new implementations will follow the same.
